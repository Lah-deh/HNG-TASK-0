HNG Stage 0 – Testable Profile Card
Overview

This project is my submission for HNG Frontend Stage 0.
It’s a simple, responsive, and accessible profile card built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

The card shows:

My name and short bio
My photo
The current time in milliseconds (auto-updating)
My social links
My hobbies and dislikes

Every visible element includes the required data-testid attributes for automated testing.
